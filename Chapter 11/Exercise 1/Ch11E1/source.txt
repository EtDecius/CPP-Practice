FINALLY…I can speak about our plans for this year. Technically, we are still earlier than last year, but everyone has been really excited to announce for a while now. When we picked up the roster last year we definitely thought there was lots of talent, but what we didn’t expect is that this would come about so fast and so convincingly. I have to give massive props to KuroKy whose understanding of team building is one of a kind, and it is an honor working alongside each other on providing everything a competitive team needs. By getting second at two majors and winning Epicenter, our Dota team achieved new heights that we will be proud of forever. That thanks extends to all members of the team, even those that will not be with us going forward. JerAx, FATA-, Blitz, you guys are awesome. Thanks for everything and best of luck with your new endeavors.
