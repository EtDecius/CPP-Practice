Lyrics to "Guarantees" by Atmosphere
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/atmosphere/guarantees.html

[V1]
These warehouse wages kill the end's introduction
Man, I should've schooled it up when I was younger, should've stuck to plan
Always had the dreams of being more self-assertive
And my kid's a teenager, now he needs the health insurance
So break my body, break break my soul down
Just another zombie walking blindly through your ghost town
Pull up to the bar to politic and tap the power
Ain't nobody really all that jolly at your happy hour
But I don't wanna go home yet
So I'ma talk to my cigarette and that television set
It doesn't matter what brand or station
Anything to take away from the current situation
No overtime pay, no holiday
Months behind on everything but the lottery
Winter 'round the corner, guaranteeing that my car dies
Wifey having trouble trying to juggle both the part-times
My cup ain't close to filled up
We trying to build up so we could have enough
And when I finally get the color, won't be nothing else to paint on
A friend of mine tried to kill himself to the same song

[V2]
My better half is mad at making magic out of can goods
My tax bracket status got her questioning my manhood
My shorty got caught smoking weed at a concert
And if I smack him everybody treats me like a monster
My neighbors ain't doing much better
And we making competition instead of sticking together
Can't save no nest egg, in fact this nest is rented
In fact that rent is late, wait
The money ain't here, the raise ain't coming
Just me and my son and that crazy woman
And those bartenders, this whole fucking country
Got everybody swallowing that lunch meat
Maybe we could speed up the process
Kill me in my thirties in the name of progress
Put me in the dirt and then change the topic
Sometimes seems like the only way to stop it
Contemplate my departure date
Doesn't take a lot to get a lot of us to talk this way
Take a shot at me, that's all I'm obligated for
Apparently my only guarantee is I'll walk-away

[Outro x2]
The only guarantee in life
Is a life worth dying for
Cause death don't wait for no one
It's sitting on yo front door
